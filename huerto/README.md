# Huerto

Showcase project to have a structured research approach.
It simulates an interactions between a developer and a customer.

- **Customer**: wants an easy to use and modern web application
- **Developer**: wants to develop the application as simple as possible

Therefore, the developer needs to research and evaluate different approaches to build the application
as simple as possible while still meeting customer requirements.

Huerto is about managing a vegetable garden. In each iteration (season), the customer has new requriements.
